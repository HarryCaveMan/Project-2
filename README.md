## Application Description

EventHop is an application that allows users to choose from several different activities (restaurants, bars, baseball games, etc) to create a 'route' of activities that they can plan for an afternoon or night out!  

When the user loads the application, they must create a user name and password to get autheniticated for the site.  They are then greeted by a splash page with gives the user three options:

**1. Create your own Route**

**2. Join a Group Route**

**3. Join an Event with other users**


#### Create Your Own Route

Users can choose from different categories to find the kind of event they are looking for, they can then link up to three different locations together to create a route that gives information and ratings for each location as well as how long it takes to walk to the next area (past a certain distance car travel time will be given instead).  The route is then saved to the user's account and will persist through login/logout.  
 
#### Join a Group Route

 When a user clicks on this option, the page loads the five 'Group routes' with the most users on the map and it describes the five groups and where they are going below the map.  Users can also create a 'Group route' that other users can then join.  Groups are named by the original creator but any user can keep track of their groups when they login to EventHop.  Group markers on the map will display the number of users that are in the group, so the user can easily see how popular each specific group will be!
 
#### Join a Pre-Planned Event

EventHop also features pre-planned 'Events' that usually involve a meal, an activity, and one other stop.  Events will cost money upfront, which can be payable via the Stripe API through the app, with all credit card information being secure and protected.  These events are a great way to get out and meet/mingle with new people!  They are also ideal for tourists or people visiting from out of town.
