## Project Description

EventHop is an application that allows users to choose from three different options to create a 'route' of activities for a night downtown!  The route gets shown on a google-maps splash on the screen.  Users must create a user-name and password so they can be authenticated on the website.  Upon authentication, the user is shown three options to choose from:

	1. Create your own route!
	2. See what popular groups are doing!
	3. See our pre-planned event routes!

####
Create Your Own Route

This option allows the user to choose from three locations (including restaurants/bars, events, and activities in the area) and allows the user to chain them in any order they want.  If the user wants, they can grab a meal, go see a local baseball game, and then go to a bar and grab drinks after! The application keeps track of distances between all chosen locations and displays how to walk to
